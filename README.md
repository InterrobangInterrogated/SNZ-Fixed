# Super-Nostalgia-Zone
Here it is, at long last! This repository contains the code that attempts to emulate the experience of Roblox in 2008 from the modern day engine. It also comes bundled with the code I wrote to bake and upload the bevel meshes I have in the game.

I wrote a lot of the code for this between 2017 and 2019, prior to my introduction to more modern development conventions. It's not the cleanest code out there, but its serviceable.

You may use the code for this in your own projects, so long as you provide credit and a reference to where you received the code. You also must open source any code that derives from elements of this project, just keep the changes in a public fork for record keeping.

Contributions and bug fixes are welcome! I'll try to keep tabs on any pull requests submitted here. I may not be so responsive to issues, you should be familiar with how to use rojo if you want to get this running in your own studio session.
